# neveragain.tech

The response to this pledge has been much larger than we expected,
and it has required a great deal of human effort
to verify thousands of signatures,
so we will only be manually verifying signatures for a limited time.

If you would like your signature to appear on this website,
please submit it **by noon PST Dec 21**.
We will process and validate all the signatures received by that time.

After that time, you can still sign the pledge in many ways.
Remember, the pledge is a personal, individual commitment;
announcing your commitment is an invitation to others
to help you hold yourself accountable.
Here are some ways to do that:
  * Tweet "I, &lt;*your name*&gt;, hereby commit to the neveragain.tech pledge. Please stand with me and hold me to it. #neveragaintech"
  * Post "I, &lt;*your name*&gt;, hereby commit to the neveragain.tech pledge. Please stand with me and hold me to it." on your personal website or blog, with a link to http://neveragain.tech/.
  * Print out the pledge and sign it on paper.  Post it in a visible location to show solidarity and gather signatures from your teammates.  Host a signing party at your workplace.

We are heartened and grateful for your enthusiasm and support.  If you are passionate about this issue, please get involved!  There is plenty more to be done.  We'll be posting a guide to constructive action shortly.

## Can you sign the pledge?

This pledge is for people who work in the US tech industry.
This doesn't mean you have to be a programmer;
anyone who is a tech worker by profession,
either in the US or working at a US-based organization, can sign.
This includes students planning on going into tech fields,
self-employed people, and owners of US-based businesses.

## Signing by pull request

If you don't have a Twitter account but you do have a GitHub account,
please submit a pull request:

1. Go to the [`_signatures`](/_signatures/) folder.
2. Click the "Create new file" button in the upper-right corner.
3. Name the file something unique, for example: `first_name_last_name_affiliation.md`. The filename must have `.md` at the end.
4. Copy the text of the [`template.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neveragaindottech/neveragaindottech.github.io/master/template.md) file and paste it in the newly created signature file from step 3.
5. Edit the file to fill in the fields exactly as you want them to be shown.
6. Commit the file and make a pull request.
7. In your pull request description, include a link to a publicly verified profile (e.g. Keybase or LinkedIn) or a personal website, that shows ownership of your GitHub account and establishes your role in your organization (if any).
8. If you are stating an organization, please mention in your pull request description the country in which the organization is based and a brief description of the organization.  We ask for this just so we can confirm that it is a tech-related organization in the United States.
9. A volunteer will review and merge in your pull request.

In order to be accepted, your pull request must contain enough information
for us to establish that the name and affiliation (if any) in the signature
accurately represent the owner of the submitting GitHub account.

## Signing by email

If submitting a pull request isn't possible, you can sign by email,
